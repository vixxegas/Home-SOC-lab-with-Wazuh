# Home-SOC-lab-with-Wazuh # 

By the end of this project, I will have a full functional SOC (secuity operations center) lab. this project is designed to ratify and advance my capabilities in threat detection, incident response, SEIM managment through a controlled simulation of real-world tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)

###Lab overvier###
1. SEIM server: Ubuntu Server with Wazuh installed
2. Monitoring target (victim): windows 10 with a wazuh agent
3. Attack VM: Kali Linux VM, be used to simulate attacks and scans towards the victim VM
4. Network: all VMs connected on an isolated host-only-network with a static IP

##Skills##
1. virtualisation + hypervisor configuration
2. network architecture
3. SEIM deployment and managment
4. log collection and and analysis
5. threat detection
6. rule creation
7. incident investigation and forensics
